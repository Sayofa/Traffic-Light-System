# Traffic Light System

This project simulates a traffic light system with pedestrian crossing and emergency mode using an ATmega32 microcontroller. It features:
- Normal operation mode for vehicle and pedestrian lights.
- Pedestrian crossing mode activated by a button.
- Emergency flashing mode for all lights.

## Getting Started
- **Microcontroller**: ATmega32
- **Simulation Software**: Proteus
- **Compiler**: Atmel Studio
- **Clock Frequency**: 16 MHz

## Circuit Diagram
Refer to the Proteus design file for the full circuit setup.

## Usage
1. Press the pedestrian button to activate pedestrian crossing mode.
2. Press the emergency button to trigger flashing lights for all.
